On the semiclassical calculation,\\nthis originates from a complicated mixing between $\\\\lambda$ and other fields.\\nHence it may depend on the decoupling procedure. It is shown that $\\\\lambda$\\ndepends on the gauge choices such as the harmonic, dilaton gauges, and the\\nKrasnitz-Klebanov setting for $h_{\\\\mu\\\\nu}$.

The technical aspect of this\\nproblem, as usually formulated, is `why quantum corrections do not modify\\ndrastically the masses and other parameters of the Standard Model'. We argue\\nthat within type-I perturbation theory, the technical hierarchy problem is\\nsolved (a) if all massless tadpoles cancel locally over distances of order the\\nstring length in the transverse space, or (b) if the massless fields with\\nuncancelled local tadpoles propagate `effectively' in $d_\\\\perp \\\\ge 2$ large\\ntransverse dimensions. These restrictions ensure that loop corrections to the\\nStandard Model parameters decouple from the four-dimensional Planck scale,\\nexcept when there are uncancelled tadpoles in $d_\\\\perp =2$ in which case the\\ndependence on $M_P$ is logarithmic. This latter case is thus singled out as the\\nonly one in which the origin of the hierarchy would not be attributed entirely\\nto `out of this world' bulk physics.

The collider experiments, astrophysics, cosmology and gravity\\nmeasurements {\\\\it independently} point to the same lower bound on the quantum\\ngravity scale, $10^{-3}$ eV. For this value the model has experimental\\nsignatures both for colliders and for sub-millimeter gravity measurements.\\nBlack holes reveal certain interesting properties in this framework.\", 'We find the gravity solution corresponding to a large number of NS or D\\nfivebranes wrapped on a two sphere so that we have pure ${\\\\cal N}=1$ super\\nYang-Mills in the IR. The supergravity solution is smooth, it shows confinement\\nand it breaks the $U(1)_R$ chiral symmetry in the appropriate way. When the\\ngravity approximation is valid the masses of glueballs are comparable to the\\nmasses of Kaluza Klein states on the fivebrane, but if we could quantize\\nstrings on this background it looks like we should be able to decouple the KK\\nstates.', 'An infra-red fixed point of ${\\\\mathcal N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills theory is\\nbelieved to be dual to a solution of five-dimensional gauged ${\\\\mathcal N}=8$\\nsupergravity. We test this conjecture at next to leading order in the large $N$\\nexpansion by computing bulk one-loop corrections to the anomaly coefficient\\n$a-c$. The one-loop corrections are non-zero for all values of the bulk mass,\\nand not just special ones as claimed in previous work.', \"We discuss the non-constant dilaton deformed ${\\\\rm AdS}_5\\\\times{\\\\rm S}_5$\\nsolutions of IIB supergravity where AdS sector is described by black hole. The\\ninvestigation of running gauge coupling (exponent of dilaton) of non-SUSY gauge\\ntheory at finite temperature is presented for different regimes (high or low T,\\nlarge radius expansion). Running gauge coupling shows power-like behavior on\\ntemperature with stable fixed point. The quark-antiquark potential at finite T\\nis found and possibility of confinement is established. It is shown that\\nnon-constant dilaton affects the potential, sometimes reversing its behavior \\nif we compare it with the constant dilaton case (${\\\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills\\ntheory). Thermodynamics of obtained backgrounds is studied. In particular,\\nnext-to-leading term to free energy F is evaluated as $F=-{\\\\tilde V_3 \\\\over\\n4\\\\pi^2}({N^2 (\\\\pi T)^4 \\\\over 2} + {5c^2 \\\\over 768 g_{YM}^6 N{\\\\alpha'}^6 (\\\\pi\\nT)^4})$. Here $\\\\tilde V_3$ is the volume of the space part in the boundary of\\nAdS, c is the parameter coming from the non-constant dilaton and N is the\\nnumber of the coincident D3-branes.\", \"It is known that, in string sigma-model metric, the `extreme' fivebrane\\nsolution of D=10 supergravity interpolates between D=10 Minkowski spacetime and\\na supersymmetric $S^3$ compactification to a linear dilaton vacuum. We show\\nhere that, in {\\\\it fivebrane} sigma-model metric, the extreme string solution\\nof D=10 supergravity interpolates between Minkowski spacetime and a hitherto\\nunknown supersymmetric $S^7$ compactification of d=10 supergravity to a\\nthree-dimensional anti-de Sitter generalization of the linear dilaton vacuum,\\nwhich may be invariantly characterized in terms of conformal\\n  Killing vectors. The dilaton field diverges near the string core but this\\ndivergence may be eliminated by re-interpreting the string solution as the\\nextreme membrane solution of 11-dimensional supergravity. We show that the\\nlatter has an analytic extension through a regular degenerate event horizon to\\nan interior region containing a curvature singularity. We obtain analogous\\nresults for other extended object solutions of supergravity theories.\", \"In this paper, we investigate about two physically distinct classes of the\\n`one-dimensional' worldvolume solutions describing the status of an arbitrary\\nbrane in the presence of another arbitrary (flat) brane which supplies the\\nrequired supergravity background. One of these classes concerns with a relative\\n(transverse) motion of two parallel flat branes, while the other class is\\nrelated to a static configuration in which one of the branes is flat and the\\nother is curved as a cylindrical hypersurface. Global symmetries of the\\nworldvolume theory are used to show that both types of these solutions are\\ndescribed by some sort of `planar orbits' which are specified by their `energy'\\nand `angular momentum' $(E,l)$ parameters. We find that various phases of the\\n`motion' along these orbits, for different values of $(E,l)$, are easily\\ndeduced from the curve of an $E$-dependent function of the relative `distance'\\nbetween the two branes, which is somehow related to their mutual `effective\\npotential'.\", 'We give the explicit form of the four dimensional effective supergravity\\naction, which describes low energy physics of the Randall-Sundrum model with\\nmoduli fields in the bulk and charged chiral matter living on the branes. The\\nrelation between 5d and 4d physics is explicit: the low energy action is\\nderived from the compactification of a locally supersymmetric model in five\\ndimension. The presence of odd $Z_2$ parity scalars in the bulk gives rise to\\neffective potential for the radion in four dimensions. We describe the\\nmechanism of supersymmetry breaking mediation, which relies on non-trivial\\nconfiguration of these $Z_2$-odd bulk fields. Broken supersymmetry leads to\\nstabilization of the interbrane distance.', 'It has recently been proposed that the hierarchy problem can be solved by\\nconsidering the warped fifth dimension compactified on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$. Many\\nstudies in the context have assumed a particular choice for an integration\\nconstant $\\\\sigma_{0}$ that appears when one solves the five-dimensional\\nEinstein equation. Since $\\\\sigma_{0}$ is not determined by the boundary\\ncondition of the five-dimensional theory, $\\\\sigma_{0}$ may be regarded as a\\ngauge degree of freedom in a sense. To this time, all indications are that the\\nfour-dimensional Planck mass depends on $\\\\sigma_{0}$. In this paper, we\\ncarefully investigate the properties of the geometry in the Randall-Sundrum\\nmodel, and consider in which location $y$ the four-dimensional Planck mass is\\nmeasured. As a result, we find a $\\\\sigma_{0}$-independent relation between the\\nfour-dimensional Planck mass $M_{\\\\rm Pl}$ and five- dimensional fundamental\\nmass scale $M$, and remarkably enough, we can take $M$ to TeV region when we\\nconsider models with the Standard Model confined on a distant brane. We also\\nconfirm that the physical masses on the distant brane do not depend on\\n$\\\\sigma_{0}$ by considering a bulk scalar field as an illustrative example. The\\nresulting mass scale of the Kaluza-Klein modes is on the order of $M$.', \"Alternatives to Einstein's theory of general relativity can be distinguished\\nby measuring the parametrised post Newtonian parameters. Two such parameters\\n$\\\\beta$ and $\\\\gamma$, equal to one in Einstein theory, can be obtained from\\nstatic spherically symmetric solutions. For the graviton-dilaton system, as in\\nBrans-Dicke or low energy string theory, we find that if $\\\\gamma \\\\ne 1$ for a\\ncharge neutral point star, then there exist naked singularities.
